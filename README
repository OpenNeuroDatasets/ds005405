## Description
We conducted resting-state functional MRI scans on a cohort of healthy adults aged 21-79 to investigate the effects of ketones on brain function. Participants were scanned in a fasted state (overnight fast) both immediately before (Days 1 & 2, baseline) and following the administration of either a ketone bolus (Day 1) or a glucose bolus (Day 2). The ketone ester used was D-β-hydroxybutyrate (D-βHb Ketone Ester; HVMN, San Francisco, CA), administered at a dosage of 395 mg/kg based on participant body weight. The glucose beverage (Glucose Tolerance Test Beverages; Fisher Scientific, Inc., Hampton, NH) was matched calorically to the ketone drink.
